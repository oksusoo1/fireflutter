# Job

Job functionality using FireFlutter


# Administration

- Admin must create `jobOpenings` and `jobSeekers` categories and group them as `job`.


# Job Notification

- User can set notification based on the combination of search option.
  - For instance, User A wants to subscribe notification if there is a new job opening on IT in Gyungi-do, dong-hae city.
    - And A can subscribe as much notification as he wants.

- Job notification should not appear on user's notification settings since it will be available on job search screen with search combinations.
